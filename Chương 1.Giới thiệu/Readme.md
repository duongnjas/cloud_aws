# Lab 1: Get ready to race by building your own AWS DeepRacer RL model!

# Notes
- After the lab, make sure you check out new features in the console: **Garage**, where you can customize the sensors on your car, and **Community races** where you can create your own virtual races in the AWS console that you can race in with friends and colleagues.
- **DeepRacer will have three racing formats in 2020**, namely time-trial, object avoidance, and head-to-head racing.for more details on the League go to [www.deepracerleague.com](https://www.deepracerleague.com)
- **In this lab we are targeting a time-trial model**. You can get a reasonable time-trial model within 120 minutes of training.
-  Join us in the **[AWS DeepRacer Slack Community](https://deepracer-community.slack.com/)** for discussions with the community or post your questions to the [AWS DeepRacer forum](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=318).
